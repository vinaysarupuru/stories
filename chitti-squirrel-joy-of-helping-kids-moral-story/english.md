# The Joy of Helping: Chitti the Squirrel's Kind Act - A Story for Kids

Hello little readers and grown-ups! Today on our blog, we have a sweet story about a little squirrel named Chitti. This story will teach us something very important: how helping others can make us super happy! Are you ready to hear about Chitti's adventure? Let's go!

## Meet Chitti the Squirrel!

In a big, green forest, lived a little squirrel named Chitti. Chitti was very playful and loved to jump from tree to tree, nibbling on yummy fruits all day long. She was a very busy and happy squirrel!

### A Shiny Surprise!

One sunny day, while Chitti was playing, she saw something shiny on the ground under a tree. "Ooh, what's that?" Chitti wondered and scampered off to see.

Her Mommy Squirrel called out, "Chitti, be careful! Where are you going?"
"Mommy, I see something shiny! I'll just go look and come back quickly," said Chitti.
"Okay, dear, but come back soon and don't get into any trouble," Mommy Squirrel replied.

Chitti quickly hopped over to the shiny thing. It was a small, colorful piece of glass! It sparkled so brightly in the sunlight. Chitti loved it! She picked it up in her mouth and started hopping back home, feeling very pleased.

### A Sad Little Monkey

On her way, Chitti saw a little monkey named Bunty. Bunty was sitting under a tree and crying.
"What's wrong, Bunty? Why are you crying?" Chitti asked kindly.
"I lost my new toy! It looked a lot like that shiny thing in your mouth, but a little bigger," Bunty sobbed.

### Chitti's Big Heart

Chitti looked at the shiny glass in her mouth. "Oh dear, could this be Bunty's toy?" she thought. For a moment, Chitti felt a little sad. She really liked the shiny glass. But then she saw how sad Bunty was.

"Bunty, here, look. Is this your toy?" Chitti said, taking the glass out of her mouth and giving it to Bunty.
Bunty's eyes lit up! "Yes! This is my toy! Thank you, Chitti! Thank you so much!" he shouted with joy, jumping up and down.

Seeing Bunty so happy made Chitti feel incredibly happy too! Even though she had given away something she liked, Bunty's happiness made her forget all about it.

When Chitti got home, she told her Mommy Squirrel everything that had happened.
Mommy Squirrel hugged Chitti tightly and said, "You did a very good thing, Chitti. The happiness we feel when we help others is much greater than keeping something for ourselves. You learned a wonderful lesson today."
